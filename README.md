**Kotools Samples** is a [Gradle] plugin designed to help [Kotlin] library
authors integrate **read-only samples** into their documentation. It addresses a
limitation in [Dokka], which does not allow making code samples **non-editable**
or **non-executable**.

## ⭐️ Key Features

- **Readonly inlined code samples:** Displays your examples inlined in the
  documentation, ensuring they are non-editable and non-executable, preventing
  unwanted modification or execution.
- **Sample visibility in IDE:** Unlike many libraries (such as Jetpack Compose),
  Kotools Samples makes your examples visible within the IDE (e.g.,
  IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio), enhancing accessibility and usability during
  development.
- **Always correct samples:** Ensures your examples are always up-to-date by
  compiling them alongside your main and test sources. Any breaking changes in
  your codebase will trigger compilation errors, prompting you to update the
  examples.
- **Kotlin/JVM support:** Fully supports the Kotlin/JVM platform, with [Kotlin]
  Multiplatform support in future releases.
- **Seamless integration:** Works effortlessly with [Kotlin] and [Dokka],
  smoothly integrating into your Gradle build process.

## 🛠️ Installation

For adding Kotools Samples to your Kotlin/JVM project, it is recommended to use
the [Gradle] plugins DSL in [Kotlin]. Just replace the `$version` variable by
the [latest version](#kotools-samples) or by another one available in the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

```kotlin
// Plugin dependency:
plugins { id("org.kotools.samples") version "$version" }

// Library dependency:
dependency { implementation("org.kotools:samples-gradle-plugin:$version") }
```

> The `org.kotools.samples.jvm` plugin is deprecated (see
> [#42](https://github.com/kotools/samples/issues/42)).

See [this plugin on the Gradle Plugin Portal][kotools-samples-plugin] for more
installation options.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage example

Kotools Samples ensures that your code samples are integrated into your
documentation without affecting your main sources. For doing so, it creates a
source set named `sample` dedicated for code samples.

Here's a [Kotlin] sample:

```kotlin
// File location: src/sample/kotlin/IntSample.kt

import kotlin.test.Test

class IntSample {
    @Test
    fun addition() {
        val x = 1
        val y = 2
        check(x + y == 3)
    }
}
```

Reference this sample in your [Dokka] documentation:

```kotlin
// File location: src/main/kotlin/Int.kt

/**
 * Performs an addition with [x] and [y] integers (`x + y`).
 *
 * SAMPLE: [IntSample.addition]
 */
public fun addition(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
```

Here's this function's documentation generated by [Dokka] with Kotools Samples:
