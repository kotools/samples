# Kotools Samples

**Kotools Samples** is a Gradle plugin designed to help Kotlin library authors
integrate **read-only, non-editable samples** into their documentation using
Dokka.
It addresses a limitation in Dokka, which does not allow making code samples
**non-editable** or **non-executable**.

This plugin also ensures that code samples are **inlined directly in the
documentation** and are **visible from the IDE**, enhancing the developer
experience.
Unlike many Kotlin libraries, such as Jetpack Compose, Kotools Samples ensures
your examples are not only available online but also accessible directly in the
IDE during development.

Currently, **Kotools Samples is not available yet**, but will **support the
Kotlin/JVM platform** starting from its first release.
**Kotlin Multiplatform support is planned for future releases**, allowing for
even more flexibility and broader application of the plugin.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Features

- **Readonly inlined code samples:** Displays your examples inlined in the
  documentation, ensuring they are non-editable and non-executable, preventing
  unwanted modification or execution.
- **Kotlin or Java support:** Write your code samples in either Kotlin or Java,
  providing flexibility to serve a broader range of developers.
- **Sample visibility in IDE:** Unlike many libraries (such as Jetpack Compose),
  Kotools Samples makes your examples visible within the IDE (e.g.,
  IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio), enhancing accessibility and usability during
  development.
- **Always correct samples:** Ensures your examples are always up-to-date by
  compiling them alongside your main and test sources. Any breaking changes in
  your codebase will trigger compilation errors, prompting you to update the
  examples.
- **Kotlin/JVM support:** Fully supports the Kotlin/JVM platform, with Kotlin
  Multiplatform support in future releases.
- **Seamless integration:** Works effortlessly with Kotlin, Java, and Dokka,
  smoothly integrating into your Gradle build process.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

Here's a Kotlin sample:

```kotlin
// src/sample/kotlin/HelloKotlinSample.kt

import kotlin.test.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class HelloKotlinSample {
    @Test
    fun greet() {
        val name = "Sample"
        val greeting: String = greet(name)
        val expected = "Hello $name!"
        assertEquals(expected, greeting)
    }
}
```

And a Java sample:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class HelloJavaSample {
    @Test
    void greet() {
        final String name = "Sample";
        final String greeting = HelloKt.greet(name);
        final String expected = "Hello %s!".formatted(name);
        Assertions.assertEquals(expected, greeting);
    }
}
```

Reference these samples in your Dokka documentation:

```kotlin
/**
 * Greets the user with the specified [name].
 *
 * Here's an example of calling this function from Kotlin code:
 *
 * SAMPLE: [HelloKotlinSample.greet]
 *
 * Here's an example of calling this function from Java code:
 *
 * SAMPLE: [HelloJavaSample.greet]
 */
fun greet(name: String = "World"): String = "Hello $name!"
```

When generating the documentation using Dokka, Kotools Samples will inline both
Kotlin and Java examples into the documentation, making them visible online and
in the IDE.
