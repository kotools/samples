**Kotools Samples** is a [Gradle] plugin designed to help [Kotlin] library
authors integrate **read-only, non-editable samples** into their documentation
using [Dokka]. It addresses a limitation in [Dokka], which does not allow making
code samples **non-editable** or **non-executable**.

This plugin also ensures that code samples are **inlined directly in the
documentation** and are **visible from the IDE**, enhancing the developer
experience. Unlike many [Kotlin] libraries, such as Jetpack Compose, Kotools
Samples ensures your examples are not only available online but also accessible
directly in the IDE during development.

Currently, Kotools Samples **supports only the Kotlin/JVM platform**. **Kotlin
Multiplatform support is planned for future releases**, allowing for even more
flexibility and broader application of the plugin.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Features

- **Readonly inlined code samples:** Displays your examples inlined in the
  documentation, ensuring they are non-editable and non-executable, preventing
  unwanted modification or execution.
- **[Kotlin] or Java support:** Write your code samples in either [Kotlin] or
  Java, providing flexibility to serve a broader range of developers.
- **Sample visibility in IDE:** Unlike many libraries (such as Jetpack Compose),
  Kotools Samples makes your examples visible within the IDE (e.g.,
  IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio), enhancing accessibility and usability during
  development.
- **Always correct samples:** Ensures your examples are always up-to-date by
  compiling them alongside your main and test sources. Any breaking changes in
  your codebase will trigger compilation errors, prompting you to update the
  examples.
- **Kotlin/JVM support:** Fully supports the Kotlin/JVM platform, with [Kotlin]
  Multiplatform support in future releases.
- **Seamless integration:** Works effortlessly with [Kotlin], Java, and [Dokka],
  smoothly integrating into your Gradle build process.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage example

Kotools Samples ensures that your code samples are integrated into your
documentation without affecting your main sources. When generating the
documentation with [Dokka], the plugin temporarily modifies the main sources to
inline the samples, and restores them afterward to avoid polluting the main
codebase. This process is transparent and automatic.

Here's a [Kotlin] sample:

```kotlin
// src/sample/kotlin/HelloKotlinSample.kt

import kotlin.test.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class HelloKotlinSample {
    @Test
    fun greet() {
        val name = "Sample"
        val greeting: String = greet(name)
        val expected = "Hello $name!"
        assertEquals(expected, greeting)
    }
}
```

And a Java sample:

```java
// src/sample/java/HelloJavaSample.java

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class HelloJavaSample {
    @Test
    void greet() {
        final String name = "Sample";
        final String greeting = HelloKt.greet(name);
        final String expected = "Hello %s!".formatted(name);
        Assertions.assertEquals(expected, greeting);
    }
}
```

Reference these samples in your [Dokka] documentation:

```kotlin
// src/main/kotlin/Hello.kt

/**
 * Greets the user with the specified [name].
 *
 * Here's an example of calling this function from Kotlin code:
 *
 * SAMPLE: [HelloKotlinSample.greet]
 *
 * Here's an example of calling this function from Java code:
 *
 * SAMPLE: [HelloJavaSample.greet]
 */
fun greet(name: String = "World"): String = "Hello $name!"
```

Here's the resulting documentation generated by [Dokka] with Kotools Samples:
